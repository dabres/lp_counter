# Yugioh Life Points Counter

Tried making a copy of https://www.yugiohcalculator.com/ which seams to be down nowadays.
(http://web.archive.org/web/20170709041558/https://www.yugiohcalculator.com/)

The site used some framework and minified the javascript, so I wrote pure JS from scratch but copied the layout since I already had the muscle memory.

# PWA

The project is a working installable progressive web app.  
Its used on my github site in the lp_counter folder, so if you copy this code you may need to change the paths in the service worker.

# Bugs

Might not work on all screens sizes / aspect ratios.

# Possible Updates

- viewable log
- fixed scaling
